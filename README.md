## 🚀 About Me

🖖 **Closet Trekkie**: Built "trekkie" to track 800+ Star Trek episodes in chronological order - Live Long and Prosper, and may your code compile on the first try

🎧 **Podcast Hoarder**: Created "bapp" because apparently the world needed another podcast app (currently in the prestigious "works on my machine" phase)

💪 **Fitness Procrastinator**: Made "Swole-Timer" to time my workouts - now I have no excuse except pure laziness

🤖 **AI Tinkerer**: Cooking up "autonomix" because I'm too lazy to do things myself (see a pattern here?)

🏛️ **Digital Monk**: Built "Abbey" - what happens there stays in the repo

📊 **Manager of Managers**: "MB-Manager" exists because I needed to manage... something. Still figuring out.

🔐 **Reformed Script Kiddie**: Graduated from SANS Cyber Security Academy (they actually gave me a certificate!)

🐧 **Linux Evangelist**: Will judge your OS choice, but I'll do it with a smile and offer you help switching distros
